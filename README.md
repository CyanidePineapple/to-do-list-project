# To Do List App
Welcome to my To-Do List Project! Now introducing ads that...well add the feeling everybody loved in the 2000s of going to your favorite website and seeing they either got hacked or just really like money because geez where did all these ads come from! Most of them of course were either widely inappropriate, illegal or just weird.

We hope to recreate that feeling while also providing the functionality of your typical checklist application. Offering all the neccesities such as adding, changing, or deleting something from your list as well as recieving visual confirmation on the screen of you actuallly doing those things!

## Getting Started

Deployment Links Coming Soon!
